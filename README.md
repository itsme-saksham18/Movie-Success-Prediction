# Movie Revenue Prediction
### Basic Details
This project predicts movie revenue based on various features like genre, runtime, rating, votes, and metascore. It uses a Random Forest Regression model to make predictions. The dataset contains information about movies, which is preprocessed and used to train the model.

### How It Works
- Data Loading: The movie dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- Data Preprocessing: Missing values in columns like Revenue (Millions) and Metascore are filled with their mean values. New features such as Director.Popularity and Actor.Popularity are created.
- Feature Engineering: The main genre of each movie is extracted from the Genre column.
- Model Training: A Random Forest model is trained on the processed data.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) on the test dataset.
